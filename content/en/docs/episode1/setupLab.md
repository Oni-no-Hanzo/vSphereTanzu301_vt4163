On the next page you will find the first in a series of videos where Ben Corrie walks you through the whole process of deploying and using vSphere with Tanzu.

This particular video focuses on the lab setup we're going to use for the series, the networking prerequisites and setting up routing using Linux gateways.

This series does assume you have a lab environment with vCenter and ESXi hosts available for the lab work.

If you already have a lab set up with vSphere with Tanzu and workload management enabled, skip ahead to [Episode 4](/vSphereTanzu301_vt4163/docs/episode4/).
