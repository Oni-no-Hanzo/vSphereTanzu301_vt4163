On the next page you will find the second in a series of videos that walk you through the whole process of deploying and using vSphere with Tanzu.

This particular video focuses on setting up a nested vSphere Cluster in an existing vCenter using the networking we configured in episode 1. The nested vSphere Cluster is often used by our customers for situations where they want a sandbox type of environment. 

This session is especially important for understanding validating and troubleshooting along the journey to setting up the environment. 

If you already have a lab set up with workload management enabled, take the knowledge check in this module and then skip ahead to video 4.
